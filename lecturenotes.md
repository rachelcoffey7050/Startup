### History of the web

There was redundancy built in by the department of defense.

More computers in this classroom than on the internet in 1973.

The Web Father - Tim Berners-Lee. Sharing papers over the internet. Took TCP and DNS ideas and made the world wide web. 
stml from the publishing industry was adapted to html

Hakin Wium Lie thought html was ugly so he created CSS for styling and animation.
Go play with it! Revert back with git if you mess it up.

Brendan Eich - Javascript. Makes things interactive. "Always bet on JS." 

### Asking Questions
In order to succeed in this class, you need to know how to ask questions. Ask yourself first (use your brain), then Web/AI, Peers, TA, Instructor.
Guidelines for getting help:
- don't use anything you don't understand
- Ask AI to explain, _then rewrite it from scratch_
- Ask AI to critique your code

### Editors
*Look up how to do multiple select in VS Code
Console - navigates the disk, runs console applications, run scripts. (git bash)
vi/vim is on everyone's computers. Important to know.
